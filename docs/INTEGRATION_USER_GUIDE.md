### Testing Connections

After configuring an integration:

1. Click **Test Connection**
2. The system will verify your credentials
3. Results are displayed immediately
4. If the test fails, check the error message and update credentials

### Disconnecting an Integration

To remove an integration:

1. Open the provider detail page
2. Click **Disconnect**
3. Confirm the action
4. All credentials and tokens will be deleted

⚠️ **Warning**: Disconnecting will stop all automated synchronization and webhooks.

---

## Service Management

Some providers offer multiple services (like AI models or meeting types). You can:

### Enable/Disable Services

### Set Default Service

1. Click the star icon (⭐) next to a service
2. The service becomes the default for that provider
3. The default service is used when no specific service is requested

**Note**: You cannot disable the default service. Set another service as default first.

### Service Features

Each service displays:
- Name and description
- Features (as badges)
- Cost information (if applicable)
- Beta status (if in beta)

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Test Failed

**Problem**: "Invalid API key" or "Authentication failed"

**Solutions**:
1. Verify you copied the entire API key (no extra spaces)
2. Check if the API key has expired
3. Ensure the API key has the required permissions
4. For OAuth providers, try disconnecting and reconnecting

### OAuth Redirect Error

**Problem**: "Invalid state" or "Authorization failed"

**Solutions**:
1. Clear your browser cookies and cache
2. Try the OAuth flow again
3. Ensure pop-ups are not blocked
4. Check that the redirect URL is whitelisted in the provider's settings

### Slow Response Times

**Problem**: Average response time >1000ms

**Solutions**:
1. Check the provider's status page for outages
2. Verify your internet connection
3. Contact the provider's support if persistent
4. Consider using a different region/endpoint if available

### Low Success Rate

**Problem**: Success rate <80%

**Solutions**:
1. Review error messages in the usage analytics
2. Check if you've exceeded rate limits
3. Verify API key permissions
4. Ensure webhook signatures are correct (if using webhooks)
5. Contact support with specific error messages

### Integration Not Appearing

**Problem**: Provider not showing in Integration Hub

**Solutions**:
1. Check if the provider is marked as "Coming Soon"
2. Ensure you have admin permissions
3. Refresh the page
4. Clear browser cache

### Webhook Not Working

**Problem**: Real-time updates not arriving

**Solutions**:
1. Verify webhook URL is accessible (not behind firewall)
2. Check webhook signature verification settings
3. Review webhook logs in the provider's dashboard
4. Ensure webhook events are subscribed correctly
5. Test with the provider's webhook testing tool

## Best Practices

### Security

1. **Rotate API Keys Regularly**: Update keys every 90 days
2. **Use Environment-Specific Keys**: Separate keys for dev/staging/production
3. **Monitor Usage**: Check analytics weekly for anomalies
4. **Limit Permissions**: Only grant necessary scopes

### Performance

1. **Cache Responses**: Use caching where appropriate
2. **Batch Requests**: Combine multiple operations when possible
3. **Set Timeouts**: Configure appropriate timeout values
4. **Monitor Costs**: Track usage to avoid unexpected bills

### Maintenance

1. **Test After Updates**: Verify connections after system updates
2. **Document Changes**: Keep notes on configuration changes
3. **Review Analytics**: Check success rates monthly
4. **Update Webhooks**: Keep webhook URLs current
